# Diemensionality :
__Dimensionality in statistics refers to how many attributes a dataset has. For example, healthcare data is notorious for having vast amounts of variables (e.g. blood pressure, weight, cholesterol level). In an ideal world, this data could be represented in a spreadsheet, with one column representing each dimension.__

# Diemensioanlity Reduction
* When you have a dataset with thousands of features maybe 50,000 features, say it is a really large sample data that we are working. 
* It becomes really hectic to work with such huge amount of data, especially you have no idea where to start with!
* Having a high number of variables is both a boon and a curse. It’s great that we have loads of data for analysis, but it is challenging due to size.
* It’s not feasible to analyze each and every variable at a microscopic level. It might take us days or months to perform any meaningful analysis and we’ll lose a ton of time and money for our business! Not to mention the amount of computational power this will take. 
* We need a better way to deal with high dimensional data so that we can quickly extract patterns and insights from it.
* Here are some techniques which I belive are good to use to overcome the huge dimensioanality of the data.
### Common dimensionality reduction techniques :
1. Missing Value Ratio
