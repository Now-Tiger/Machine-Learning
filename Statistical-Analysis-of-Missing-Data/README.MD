# Statistical Analysis of Missing Data :
* Statistical analysis of data sets with missing values is a pervasive problem for which standard methods are of limited value.  
* Analysis of data with missing values where inferences are based on likelihoods derived from formal statistical models for the data-generating and missing-data mechanisms.
* In above files I've tried to implement few __methods__ to deal with missing values and checking each methods impact on building model by checking accuracy score of that model.

# Missing Data :
>* In statistics, missing data, or missing values, occur when no data value is stored for the variable in an observation. 
>* Missing data are a common occurrence and can have a significant effect on the conclusions that can be drawn from the data.

>* Missing data can occur because of nonresponse: no information is provided for one or more items or for a whole unit ("subject"). 
>* Some items are more likely to generate a nonresponse than others: for example items about private subjects such as income. 
>* __Attrition__ is a type of missingness that can occur in longitudinal studiesâ€”for instance studying development where a measurement is repeated after a certain period of time. 
>* Missingness occurs when participants drop out before the test ends and one or more measurements are missing.

>* These forms of missingness take different types, with different impacts on the validity of conclusions from research : Missing completely at random, missing at random, and missing not at random. 
> * Missing data can be handled similarly as censored data.
