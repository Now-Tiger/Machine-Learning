# Machine Learning & Data Science knowledge with statistics.
* __What is Machine-Learning ?__

* “Machine Learning is the science of getting computers to learn and act like humans do, and improve their learning over time in autonomous fashion, by feeding them data and information in the form of observations and real-world interactions.”

* “Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed.” 

* __Dr. Yoshua Bengio, Université de Montréal :__ Machine learning research is part of research on artificial intelligence, seeking to provide knowledge to computers through data, observations and interacting with the world. That acquired knowledge allows computers to correctly generalize to new settings.
