# Machine learning algorithms here : 
* __Supervised :__
* In Supervised learning every training sample from dataset has a corresponding label and output value(s) associated with it. As a result, algorithm learns to predict the labels or output values.

* __Unsupervised :__
* In Unsupervised learning there are no labels for training data. The machine learning algorithms tries to learn underlying patterns or distributions that govern the data.

* __reinforcement learning :__ 
* The algorithm figures out which actions to take in a situation to maximize a reward (in the form of a number) on the way to reaching a specific goal. This is a completely different approach than supervised and unsupervised learning. We will dive deep into this in the next lesso
