# Classification machine learning algorithms
> In machine learning, classification is a supervised learning concept which basically categorizes a set of data into classes. The most common classification problems are â€“ speech recognition, face detection, handwriting recognition, document classification, etc. It can be either a binary classification problem or a multi-class problem too. There are a bunch of machine learning algorithms for classification in machine learning. Let us take a look at those classification algorithms in machine learning.
