Variability :
-   Variability describes how far apart data points lie from each other and from the center
    of a distribution. Along with the measure of central tendancy, measure of variability give
    you descriptive statistics that summarize your data.
-   Variability also referred as spread, scatter or dispersion.
-   It is most commonly measured with the following :
    -   Range : the differnce between the highest and lowest values.
    -   Interquartile range : the range of the middle half of a distribution.
    -   Standard deviation : average distance from the mean.
    -   Variance : average of squared distance from the mean.


Why does the variability matter ?
-   While the central tendency, or average, tells you where most of your points lie, 
    variability summarizes how far apart they are. 
-   This is important because it tells you whether the points tend to be clustered around the center 
    or more widely spread out.

-   Low variability is ideal because it means that you can better predict information about the 
    population based on sample data. 
-   High variability means that the values are less consistent, so it’s harder to make predictions.

-   Data sets can have the same central tendency but different levels of variability or vice versa. 
    If you know only the central tendency or the variability, you can’t say anything about the other aspect. 
    Both of them together give you a complete picture of your data.
